However, they also seek<br> audience with priests and other worshippers of the temples, attempting<br> to gain converts to their crusade against Chaos. Though they may gain<br> the adoration of a few zealots, such attempts to gain followers usually<br> lead to suggestions as to where Chaos might be fought\u2026far away from<br> the temples.<br> By that measure, flagellants haunt ruins, caves, and other places<br> where creatures of Chaos are rumoured to lair. If the taint of Chaos is<br> mentioned in connection to a particular place, odds are that a flagellant<br> patrols somewhere nearby.<br> Flagellants have few allies and even fewer friends. This, of course, is<br> their own doing \u2013 they believe that people who do not blindly follow<br> their causes with slavish devotion are enemies at best, and conspirators<br> of Chaos at the worst.

However, a wizard lives in<br> Richtenhoff and the Manticore is merely his illusion. The spell distresses<br> the villagers, but spares them the depredations of bandits. The wizard<br> plans to continue his chicanery until the brigands are brought to justice.<br> Defending the Homeland: News reaches a Slayer that Karak Kadrin is<br> under assault.

There are<br> others, however, who are just too ferocious to readily die. These rare few become Giant<br> Slayers: obsessed Dwarfs who have found that not even Trolls could offer a sufficient<br> enough challenge to give them the glorious ending they crave. They continue to seek out<br> combat and a proper death wherever they go, many of them becoming morose drinkers<br> when they aren\u2019t in the midst of battle. Giant Slayers continue to sport the spiky orange<br> Slayer crest, but they tend to be covered with far more tattoos.<br> Note: Only Dwarfs can enter this career.

The warlock<br> rejects these deceptions, and embraces Chaos lore and Dark Magic as<br> essential components to controlling aethyr.<br> On Dark Magic: Although the tedious witch hunters constantly<br> lecture that the slightest exposure to Dark Magic is highly corruptive,<br> this is another gross exaggeration intended to spread fear and<br> misinformation. Dark Magic, or Dhar, is simply the stagnation of<br> aethyric energy. As such, a proficient warlock can manipulate and<br> control it in the same way that the blacksmith manipulates fire.<br> On Necromancy: It is a simple matter for the elves to condemn<br> necromancy, since they often live for hundreds of years or more. Why<br> should mankind be condemned to a fraction of that time when there<br> exists an opportunity to extend life? The ancient Lahmians venerated<br> necromancy and they were among the most advanced civilisations of<br> their time. The creation of undead minions is a situation borne out of<br> necessity, when one is hunted across every acre of his homeland.<br> On Daemonology: The warlock\u2019s trade with daemonkind is perhaps<br> the truest example of his even-handed approach to the study of the<br> aethyr. For what better specimen to learn from than a denizen of the<br> aethyr itself! The summoning of daemons is a perilous business, but<br> minor daemons are quite limited mentally and easy to control. Greater<br> daemons can be a bit trickier to deal with, and it is imperative to<br> establish dominance early.<br> Adventure Seeds<br> The Price of Power: A Strigoi vampire is willing to trade the ancient<br> secrets of Blood Magic for assistance on a dangerous river journey.

They are<br> the bogeymen of the witch hunters, the spellcasters that are a danger to themselves and to<br> others. Warlocks tend to be either Daemonologists or Necromancers. Since they are selftaught<br> and so much of their magic is based on experimentation, however, most Warlocks<br> have unique views of magic and the world.
