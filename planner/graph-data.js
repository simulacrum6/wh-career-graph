No matter where in the Old World it lies, there are a number of factors that go into designating a building an \u201cembassy:\u201d \u2022\t It is one of the highest-quality buildings in its settlement. \u2022\t It is secure, with guards at every visible egress and an external defence (such as a curtain wall or portcullis). \u2022\t There is more than one entry\/exit, though only the primary needs to be undisguised. \u2022\t There are at least eight embassy guards for each ambassador, beyond his personal guards. \u2022\t It is large enough to comfortably accomodate several ambassadors and their retinues without needing to overcrowd them. \u2022\t The kitchens and servants quarters are routinely examined, and cooking is done under the watchful eye of guards, to discourage any attempts at poisoning. Hedeon Dyakanov Born during the great blizzards of 2468 at the Dyakanov estate on the River Urskoy, Hedeon\u2019s ice-silver eyes deemed him \u201cUlric-marked\u201d from birth. In time, his tongue proved equally silver as he charmed many far beyond the means of his nigh-insolvent noble house. Brought to the Kislevite court at a young age, Hedeon fled after incurring the vengeful jealousy of certain noble courtiers. His time in exile in the Bretonnian courts and the southern Empire taught him a greater command of politics, both provincial and personal. It also helped him build an unmatched personal network of contacts and allies among many countries. Since the Ice Queen\u2019s rise, Lord Dyakanov has served the Tzarina faithfully and earned his ambassadorial title. He has spoken her will among the courts of Bretonnia, Estalia, and the Empire and she has rewarded his family with riches for his service. As one of her covert foreign spymasters, he receives intelligence from many sources within Reikland and Wissenland. Hedeon has also used his position to wreak secret vengeance upon the families who forced his exile decades ago. Now, if any dare speak against him, they do so quietly, for his retribution has a leagues-long reach. Adventure Seeds The Delicate Art of Diplomacy: The party serves an ambassador of a foreign country, and they may act as personal guards (or thugs), investigators (or spies), and scouts (or explorers and mappers) at various times. The ambassador\u2019s title and position protects them from all but the most egregious abuses of power in the execution of the ambassador\u2019s orders. Their first task is to escort the ambassador\u2019s daughter safely from Nuln to Marienburg. Treating with Tilea: As a newly-titled ambassador (or a group of ambassadors), the party is charged with negotiating and establishing trade consortia between their country\u2019s lands and as many of the Tilean city-states as they can. The party must also make steps to guarantee the safety of goods and peoples from their lands to Tilea and back. Ambassador To fight for one\u2019s lands is a privilege. To speak for one\u2019s lands is an honor.","Trappings":["Ambassadors are representatives of their governments","empowered to deal on behalf of their lands.As such","they must look the part.","Ambassadors must have several sets of superior noble\u2019s garb","and many also have valuable jewellery to enhance their ensemble.

It would certainly be remiss of them not to contact the dwarf\u2019s family and old associates to tell them of the manner of his passing. Such a journey could be perilous in itself, as the dwarf holds lie in remote mountainsides. The reception may not be a warm one either, and if the news is not good (for example the slayer may have died in a dishonourable manner \u2013 by accident or in combat with an unworthy foe) the dwarfs might hold it against the messenger. Notable Figure: Falki Ringulsson Falki Ringulsson was a young apprentice stonemason of Karak Hirn. His master, Gotri, allowed Falki to oversee the completion of a joist they erected in a feasting hall. Five months later, during raucous celebrations, part of the roof gave way and crushed the revellers underneath. It seemed his joist had proved the weak point and Falki blamed himself. Gotri tried to console his apprentice, explaining that accidents happen, but Falki fell into a deep depression and took no solace from anyone\u2019s sympathy. After months of his apprentice\u2019s moping Gotri suggested making atonement might ease his apprentice\u2019s conscience. He didn\u2019t mention any particular penance, but everyone knew what was implied. Falki shaved the sides of his head, dyed his hair a bright orange, and swore the slayer oath. He travelled to exotic locales, met wondrous beasts, and slew them. Seventeen years later, few dwarfs from Karak Hirn would recognise the now mighty Falki Ringulsson. He has faced down some of the most dreadful opponents the Old World has to offer and has earned the title of daemon slayer. However, a secret bitterness lurks in Falkri\u2019s heart. No longer a callow youth, he now considers Gotri responsible for the accident that led to his shame, reasoning that the master mason convinced him to take the oath to focus blame on Falki. If the mason had taken his responsibilities seriously he would have checked that his apprentice\u2019s work was sound. Falki wants one last meeting with Gottri before meeting his doom. Adventure Seeds Suffer No Guilt: A party of dwarfs cross the path of the daemon slayer, and to his horror, he recognises that one of them knows of the great shame that led him to taking the Slayer oath. The dwarfs reassure the daemon slayer they are not angry. They have sought him out and they wish to talk. They explain that there were mistakes made in the past and the daemon slayer\u2019s name has been cleared \u2013 he was not responsible for the dishonour he feels he must atone for. The dwarfs are not so na\u00efve as to believe any slayer would ever turn his back on his oath, but they want him to know he can go to his doom with a clear conscience. A Scholarly Approach: A daemon slayer increasingly worries about what tales he leaves to prosperity, and seeks out ever-rarer opponents in order to find his doom at the hands of a truly remarkable foe. Daemon slayers have even been observed taking an interest in the subject of Beastaria, poring over illustrated tomes of fabulous beasts in the library of the Altdorf University. Such individuals may even chase rumours of beasts that University professors claim are extinct or never even existed, such as the fabled Jabberwock or the half-daemonic Fen Cyclops. Daemon Slayer Phaw. That weren\u2019t so tough. Wake me when we find something worthy of my axe.","Trappings":["Great Weapon"],"Skills":["Common Knowledge (any two)","Consume Alcohol","Dodge Blow","Intimidate","Scale","Sheer Surface"],"Talents":["Lightning Parry","Unsettling"],"WS":40.0,"BS":0.0,"S":30,"T":30,"Ag":20,"Int":0,"WP":30,"Fel":0,"A":2.0,"W":8,"SB":0.0,"TB":0.0,"M":0.0,"Mag":0,"IP":0.0,"FP":0.0,"id":51,"label":"Daemon Slayer","role":"None","group":"Advanced","color":"grey","shape":"diamond","x":-1.0,"y":0.0632017697},{"Career":"Deepwatcher","Type":"Basic","Edition":"(WC)","Fluff":" To see the sun again after a long Deepwatch.

Some of this pain is the self-inflicted lashes brought on by the flagellant\u2019s constant acts of repentance. However, the flagellant also bears the painful burden of preaching the message of his gods to heathens, and leading fellow defenders of the faith into the unending war against Chaos. When not in battle against their vile enemies, flagellants often lurk in the shadows of the slums, searching for souls to save\u2026or evil to punish. However, the mad fanatics can easily find both where the sane would find none, choosing to see only what they want to see. Many times, flagellants walk into the most innocent situations and turn them into blood-soaked scenes of carnage. Flagellants also frequent the temples of the gods they worship. Mercifully, much of this time is spent in silent prayer, as they ask their deities for the strength to smite their enemies. However, they also seek audience with priests and other worshippers of the temples, attempting to gain converts to their crusade against Chaos. Though they may gain the adoration of a few zealots, such attempts to gain followers usually lead to suggestions as to where Chaos might be fought\u2026far away from the temples. By that measure, flagellants haunt ruins, caves, and other places where creatures of Chaos are rumoured to lair. If the taint of Chaos is mentioned in connection to a particular place, odds are that a flagellant patrols somewhere nearby. Flagellants have few allies and even fewer friends. This, of course, is their own doing \u2013 they believe that people who do not blindly follow their causes with slavish devotion are enemies at best, and conspirators of Chaos at the worst. Their few friends are often rogues who whisper lies to them, seeking to twist some advantage out of their insistence on seeing enemies everywhere. Notable Figures Marko von Miktar is known and feared in the city of Praag as a merciless flagellant. Formerly a soldier of the Empire, the fierce warrior was attacked and left for dead on the outskirts of the Kislevite city by beasts of Chaos. Instead of perishing in the cold, though, von Miktar received a vision from Ursun\u2026and somehow managed to drag himself back to the city despite the loss of an eye. Marko von Miktar is more a force of nature than a man, and is hard not to notice in Praag. He wears grey tattered rags, often covered in muck from the sewers he constantly walks through in search of creatures of Chaos. He speaks in a broken mishmash of Reikspiel and Kislevarin, ensuring that few can understand his words. A giant wooden cudgel, stained with the blood of his enemies, is ever-present in his hands. Adventure Seeds Unwelcome Attention: A warehouse burns to the ground near a shipyard. An ominous symbol of Khorne is found drawn in the ashes in the center of the burnt ruin. Several local ship owners tell the flagellant about the symbol, partly hoping to destroy whatever soldiers of Chaos may lurk nearby, and partly to keep looters away from the remains of the warehouse. A Bit of Trickery: A silver mine, long abandoned, is purchased by a local merchant\u2019s guild. Skaven are rumoured to live there. The merchants, unable to convince the local populace to help them explore the mine in search of skaven, begin spreading stories that a worshipper of Chaos inhabits the tunnels, trying to trick the flagellant into doing their dirty work.

On occasion, they weave gold bands and bone fragments into the wood of their bows. The elfbow of a ghost strider is considered to be an extension of the warrior\u2019s very being, and each is distinct and unique to the strider who strings it. Ghost striders are adept at living in treetops, and often build makeshift shelters high above the ground in the strong branches of mighty oaks. These shelters resemble large and messy birds\u2019 nests. Though they appear strange, they offer the ghost striders both concealment and a place to survey the forest for unwanted intruders. Many ghost striders also decorate their cloaks with the leaves of the tree in which they live. Although known for their solitary nature, ghost striders have been known to befriend extremely unlikely allies \u2013 dwarven troll slayers. Though ghost striders do not care for the troll slayers\u2019 brutal tactics in battle, they feel a kinship towards the dwarves\u2019 single-minded dedication to destroying evil. When a ghost strider and a troll slayer cross paths, they may team up for a brief while, until the foes they seek individually lead them apart once more. When ghost striders defeat an enemy in battle, they make a small cut in their forearms to commemorate the victory. Veteran ghost striders often only have to bare their heavily-scarred arms into order to drive away cowardly opponents. Some human nobles have attempted to make ghost striders the wardens of their forests, in order to protect the woodlands from evil. Such appointments \u2013 when accepted \u2013 have virtually always ended in disaster, as what the nobles and the ghost striders believe to be evil are entirely different things. Notable Figures Celanoth the Blade is perhaps the most infamous ghost strider to inhabit the Forest of Loren. Originally apprenticed to a wizard, his renowned skill with the bow first became evident when he and his master were ambushed by a group of orc brigands. Celanoth\u2019s arrows quickly felled all their foes. Some say that Celanoth still indeed possesses a talent for magic\u2026it just manifests in his bow. Celanoth shuns most inhabited places, preferring the solitude of the woods. However, the elven warrior almost always has company. Wherever the ghost strider goes, a small cadre of foxes is certain to follow, and even wolves are known to occasionally join his company. Celanoth\u2019s is well-known for his ruby-tipped arrows. Early in his career, the ghost strider shattered a ruby amulet worn by a Chaos wizard. He took the shards of the ruby and placed them in the tips of his finest arrows, which he saves for foes he deems worthy of honor. Adventure Seeds The Tained Tree: In the heart of a nearby forest, a giant tree turns black and begins to grow even larger. Its ebon branches and roots cause all it touches to wither and die. The ghost strider heads deep into the forest to learn why this tree has turned into a malevolent force of Chaos. Missing Children: Children have been disappearing from a village located at the edge of a forest. The villagers find traces of the kidnapper\u2019s trail leading deep into the woods\u2026but cannot find any sign of the children. Desperate for assistance, they ask the ghost strider to follow the trail and learn where the missing children have been taken...and to slay the kidnapper, if possible.

Dwarfs usually give slayers a wide berth, and can even treat them suspiciously \u2013 after all, what did they do to dishonour themselves? However, the Dwarfs of Karak Kadrin welcome Slayers, saving a place for them beside the hearth and plying them with pints of Bugman\u2019s. The Shrine of Grimnir is here, founded by Baragor, the first of the Slayer Kings. Baragor\u2019s descendant, Ungrim Ironfist, rules Karak Kadrin. He has not only inherited his forefathers\u2019 throne, but the Slayer Oath as well. As a result, he is torn between two conflicting vows, a Slayer must seek a worthy doom, but a king must protect his people. Slayers often stop at Karak Kadrin during their wanderings, to pay their respects at the Shrine of Grimnir and enjoy the company of dwarfs who understand them. Adventure Seeds A Great Threat: The inhabitants of Richtenhoff live in fear of a Manticore that is often seen gliding above. Giant slayers always have an ear out for news of such monsters, for to fall in combat against a Manticore makes a worthy doom. However, a wizard lives in Richtenhoff and the Manticore is merely his illusion. The spell distresses the villagers, but spares them the depredations of bandits. The wizard plans to continue his chicanery until the brigands are brought to justice. Defending the Homeland: News reaches a Slayer that Karak Kadrin is under assault.

He claimed the title of Grail knight younger than most and swore himself to the defence of the Grail shrine where the Lady had appeared to him. He faithfully executed his duties for years until finally he received a messenger who informed him that his beloved sister, Sybilla, was dying. He took leave of his duties and rushed to her death bed. While he was away, the shrine was desecrated by a band of thirteen bandits \u2013 desperate men who scoured the land for gold and plunder. When he returned, his sister finally blessed and buried, Sir Berenger was filled with divine rage. He swore that he would hunt all the violators down. He tracked them across the full length and breadth of the Old World. Now he has slain all but one \u2013 their leader, the villainous Rainouart Ducharme. Rainouart knows he is hunted and so, in his desperation, has sworn devotion to the ruinous power, Tzeentch, in the hope that the Lord of Change will protect him from Sir Berenger\u2019s wrath. Instead, he has become a pawn in the Changer of Ways\u2019s schemes to corrupt and transform this great knight into a servant of darkness. Will Sir Berenger give in to his rage and his need for revenge and become that agent? Or will he avenge the Lady\u2019s dishonour and rise to become one of Bretonnia\u2019s great heroes? Only the future can tell. The Seven of Salles This band of seven Grail knights all sipped from the sacred chalice the same day after slaying the dragon Hallerung in the Fields of Salles. Thus their fates were bound together. It is said by some that at the completion of their great quest, the Lady of the Lake laid a new mission upon them \u2013 a quest so important and secret that the very destiny of Bretonnia and perhaps all the Old World hinges upon it. Since then they have scattered all across the Old World on this mysterious quest. There are many theories concerning what they seek, but few facts. What is certain is that these Grail knights have been hunting down and slaying witches. A squire heard one of them demanding from his defeated opponent to know the location of \u201cthe Hag\u2019s Eye\u201d. The meaning of this cryptic demand remains unclear.

The hag cackled with amusement. \u2018I have asked. I so have,\u2019 she replied and threw a handful of petals into the air. The group waited expectantly but no more explanation was forthcoming. The ataman spoke again, prompting her. \u2018And what did they say?\u2019 The hag cackled again, but this time, bitterly. \u2018They say they need a baby.\u2019 The ataman signalled to two men who quickly slipped away. They returned a few moments later, one of them carrying a small bundle. The baby was crying loudly, and in the distance they could hear her mother screaming. \u2018Take it,\u2019 said the ataman. \u2018And do what you have promised.\u2019 The hag walked from the village, babe in arms, cackling. Recipe for Warding off Witches Mix one cup dried goats blood with one of mashed feathers and a whole peeled and chopped onion. Drain the fluid of a she-wolf in labour, and mix with a lump of finest cheese (Grubentreich is best). Take a raven\u2019s kidney and cut it up with a sprig of graveroot and two sprigs of parsley. Boil up the she-wolf\u2019s head for two days and drain the broth. Mix all together and drain into a silver bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. Leave to set. Drink half and paint yourself from head to toe with the other half, so no hag can curse you. Only good for half an hour.

It was on a particularly cold night, the air thick with hoarfrost and breath of man and animal alike freezing as they breathed, that Magdala left her village of Vostoya and ventured deep into the woods. To this day, she cannot fully explain why she chose this night. Or why she felt compelled to wander into the woods with naught but a cotton shift to keep her safe. It was as if Magdala and the bitter chill had reached some sort of pact. A mutual respect for each other; she a respect for the fearsome cold and the power it held over life and death, the cold a respect for Magdala\u2019s purpose and destiny. For it was on this night that Magdala Ostrovek found the carved ice hut of Babya Yigg, the Witch of the Woods that struck fear into the hearts of the townfolk. But no such fear touched Magdala\u2019s heart. As she approached, Babya Yigg greeted her at the door and draped a thick ice bear\u2019s fur across the young girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI have been waiting for you,\u201d the old witch said, a smile cracking her withered face. Magdala remembers that Babya had the most amazing, most intense eyes. As if hewn from a piece of the purest, coldest ice. The eyes, that smile, the comforting embrace and warm furs. All these things told Magdala that she had truly found her home. Vostoya was already a fading memory, a place she once knew. This place is where she would learn, grow and truly live, for the first time in her life. Adventure Seeds The Lost Girls: Several young girls from nearby villages have gone missing.

Ice witches are impervious to cold, for the Ice Magic runs through their bodies and no other cold can compare. Ice witches rarely die, at least not in the normal sense. Most ice witches, when they feel their life ebbing away and their control and focus fading, slip off into the wilds of Kislev. There they release the Ice Magic within, letting it wash over them and transform them, making them one with their power. Stories tell of places where frozen ice witches stand like monuments to winter, each one turned to ice. Notable Figures Nadia Uneska Voreskova was born and raised in the north of Kislev, not far from the River Lynsk. Her family was nomadic, like most of the Kislevites in that region, and wandered from place to place seeking pastures for their herds and food for themselves. It was a difficult existence, and Nadia grew up strong and stern like her kin. When she was old enough, she married a man from a neighbouring tribe and went to live with his family. Their first child was a little girl, Katya. On her tenth birthday Nadia took her to the nearest village for the winter equinox celebration, and presented her to the local ice witch. The witch saw no sign of magic within Katya \u2013 but did discover a powerful spark in Nadia. Ice witches are required to apprentice any Kislev female they find with the gift, and so Nadia was told to leave her family behind. She refused. The local ice witch, unaccustomed to disobedience, insisted. When Nadia still refused, the witch attempted to coerce her with magic. With pure instinct Nadia fought back and defeated the witch, turning her instantly to ice. Frightened, Nadia took her daughter and fled back to her husband and their tribe. When the ice witches heard what had happened, they dispatched another to investigate. The ice witch they sent, Madhyana Terleska, was old, powerful, and accustomed to having her own way. She ascertained that Nadia had defeated the ice witch in fair magical battle and sought the woman out, assuring her that she would not be punished. However, Madhyana insisted Nadia travel to the nearest surviving ice witch for proper training. Again, Nadia refused. Nothing Madhyana said could sway her, and finally the old ice witch surprised even herself by offering a new solution. She joined Nadia\u2019s tribe and trained the woman herself. Under Madhyana\u2019s tutelage Nadia quickly mastered the Ice Magic, but she refused to follow the traditional path of the ice maiden \u2013 she would not under any circumstances abandon her husband, her children, or her tribe. In the end, Madhyana was forced to admit that Nadia was a full-fledged ice witch and departed, half impressed and half afraid. Since then Nadia has done her best to reconcile her two identities, and uses her magic to protect her tribe and the northern edge of Kislev. She refuses to leave them even to travel to one of the annual ice witch gatherings. Adventure Seeds The Truth of Prophecy: Rumours have sprung up of a young man who controls the Ice Magic as if he were a witch. This seems to be the coming of a powerful figure foretold in legend, one who may taint the Ice Magic forever. It is a day the ice witches have long feared. An ice witch is dispatched to find this young man, check for any truth to the rumour \u2013 and, if it is true, kill him before he can destroy their heritage. Ice Witch Now I call to the ice, and the ice answers. That is all you need to know.","Trappings":["Ice witches all wear superior winter clothing and often accent their attire with a few bits of jewellery studded with diamonds or sapphires.","As well","ice witches carry at least one magic item found during their wanderings as ice maidens."],"Skills":["Academic Knowledge (Magic","plus any one) (Int)","Channelling (WP)","","Command (Fel) or Intimidate (S)","Common Knowledge (Kislev","plus any one) (Int)","","Magical Sense (WP)","Outdoor Survival (Int) or Ride (Ag)","Perception (Int)","Read\/Write (Int)","Speak Arcane Language (Magick) (Int)","Speak","Language (Kislevarin","plus any two) (Int)"],"Talents":["Fast Hands","Lesser Magic (any three)","Menacing or Unsettling"],"WS":15.0,"BS":0.0,"S":5,"T":20,"Ag":15,"Int":30,"WP":40,"Fel":15,"A":0.0,"W":6,"SB":0.0,"TB":0.0,"M":0.0,"Mag":4,"IP":0.0,"FP":0.0,"id":101,"label":"Ice Witch","role":"None","group":"Advanced","color":"grey","shape":"diamond","x":0.5326925885,"y":0.2429594885},{"Career":"Innkeeper","Type":"Advanced","Edition":"(Core)","Fluff":" A private room\u2019s a gold piece each.

For some, the day is for sleeping in a cave in natural stone, strong and protected, a rock blocking the entrance, clutching a stake, because some of them will come for you anyway. The day is not for them. But perhaps it will be cloudy. Perhaps it will rain. Then they need not fear the sun. Once night falls, you must move, quickly, away from the places you visited the previous night. They may have been watching you and set an ambush, or be prepared to strike at your lair as soon as it is dark. Rise before the sunset, to be away and hidden before they can act. Night is for hunting. Watch the people who go out at night, for normal folk have no need to skulk around when the sun sleeps. You are no longer one of the normal folk, if you ever were, for you have a stronger calling now, one that calls louder than laws and fellowship. Those who walk by night may be the undead; watch their habits carefully. When you have tracked one of them down, strike early in the night if possible, and dismember and burn the corpse so that it does not rise again. Then flee, as fast as you can, before their allies can track you. Do not concern yourself with your destination. Wherever you find yourself, they will be waiting. Little Known Facts Killers of the Dead train suitable candidates when they find them, and two who meet often work together for a time. It is important to remember that they are obsessive, but not quite what most would term insane, at least not in most cases. A very small number of Killers of the Dead even maintain a respectable facade, with the help of a wealthy family or group of friends. These backers must be very tolerant, however, as nothing can be allowed to come before the hunt. Once one has taken the path of a Killer of the Dead, life is bleak. It is rare for a Killer of the Dead to ever pursue another path. Their devotion and single-minded purpose makes it difficult to adjust to any other way of life. Adventure Seeds A Unique Undead? The Killer of the Dead hears rumours of a vampire who has none of the normal weaknesses, happily operating in daylight, casting a reflection, ignoring religious symbols, and no more inconvenienced by stakes than a human would be. If these rumours are true, such a creature could wreak unimaginable destruction. If false, who would spread such rumours? Someone needs to get to the bottom of this mystery. A Mysterious Patron: The Killer of the Dead returns to his current lair to find clothes piled up there. He recognises them as having belonged to a victim of the last vampire he killed, one who left a family. Over the next few days, other supplies, and finally food are left, always while he is absent. This mysterious benefactor goes to great lengths to avoid direct contact with the Killer of the Dead. Then a small portrait is left, of a person in the town casting no reflection, intimating that the person is a vampire. Is the claim real, or is the Killer of the Dead being manipulated by the benefactor to hunt an innocent person?

They could go searching every nook of every vessel that comes down the river, and they\u2019d be sure to find a lot of good stuff. And they\u2019d be sure to end up with no friends, if they were lucky, and a knife in the back if they were not. A good riverwarden needs to be a friend to the boatmen, not their enemy. He needs to get to know them and learn their ways. It\u2019s best for both parties. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity to catch foreign smugglers and ne\u2019er do wells, the sorts that don\u2019t understand folk on this stretch of the river. The honest local boatman, might smuggle a bit, he\u2019s got to, really, but nothing too much, nothing that will inconvenience the duke, or bring the Empire down. And if you know where to look, or more to the point, where not to look, a good riverwarden will find plenty to keep him busy: the odd bottle of brandy, or wheel of cheese, or leg of ham, that needs to be confiscated, without rocking the boat, so to speak. The Battle of Bechbad The town of Bechbad on the Talabec, a couple of days downriver from Talabheim, had always been quite quiet. The riverwardens there had little to do but check the regular flow of cargo ships making their way up and down the great river. Until, the pirates came. In a couple of weeks, five cargoes were lost and many honest boatmen. The Bechbad riverwardens could do little; and caught no sight of he pirates, who had any number of sheltered tributaries and secluded inlets to hide in. Then the captain of the riverwardens commandeered a cargo boat. He grabbed the next suitable ship, and demanded volunteers from the townsfolk and crews that were resting in Bechbad. And so filled with vigilantes and riverwardens, the boat made its way up the river. They were soon set upon by the pirates and battle was joined. The struggle saw the pirate ship burn and sink and the commandeered vessel was badly damaged. But eventually, all the pirates lay dead or captured. And thanks to the brave men of the Bechbad riverwardens that stretch of river has not seen another pirate to this very day. Adventure Seeds Looking the Other Way: The usually loyal riverwarden is approached by some stranger to deliberately overlook a crate or two coming in on the next boat. The crate is clearly described, and all the character has to do is search a different one. The money he is offered to do so is excellent. This is a test, however. The crate is entirely legitimate. If the character passes the test, then next time he will be paid the same way but the crate will be full of illicit goods. If he does not pass the test, the boys will come round to \u2018have a word.\u2019 Greasing the Right Palm: The characers needs to get that thing down the river without the authorities getting wind of it. They need to contact a riverwarden and make sure they get away with it. Word on the bank is that the riverwardens can be bribed but you have to know what you\u2019re doing. If the characters get it right, the river warden will get their crate all the way to the destination for them without a sniff of trouble, but it will cost them.

It is a natural byproduct that some of these free-thinking dabblers come across Chaos and Dark Magic in their studies. Unfortunately, Marienburgers share the same view on the Dark Lores as their narrow-minded Imperial cousins, and allow witch hunters to operate unfettered in the city. As a consequence, the sophisticated Marienburg warlock requires a place where he can safely study \u201cthe alternative lores\u201d without risking meddlesome interference from the authorities. Such a haven can be found along a stretch of isolated coast, several leagues northeast of Marienburg. On the surface, the Hartshorn Lodge functions as a hunting and fishing retreat for the Marienburg gentry. The extensive lower dungeons and massive occult library suggest other activities, however. The Hartshorn Lodge is a place where the urbane warlock can study the Dark Lores in peace and share discoveries with like-minded fellows. As a service to its members, the lodge also employs a team of grave-robbers to keep its pantry stocked year round. The Warlock Perspective On True Magic: The great lie must be revealed. The Archmage Teclis has duped men into believing that true magic is beyond their understanding. The founding of the Eight Colleges ensures the Imperials practice a fragmented form of magic, while the devious elves withhold the real secrets to power. The vilification of the Dark Lores is yet another deception intended to curtail man\u2019s knowledge of the aethyr, by exploiting irrational fears of daemons and necromancy. The warlock rejects these deceptions, and embraces Chaos lore and Dark Magic as essential components to controlling aethyr. On Dark Magic: Although the tedious witch hunters constantly lecture that the slightest exposure to Dark Magic is highly corruptive, this is another gross exaggeration intended to spread fear and misinformation. Dark Magic, or Dhar, is simply the stagnation of aethyric energy. As such, a proficient warlock can manipulate and control it in the same way that the blacksmith manipulates fire. On Necromancy: It is a simple matter for the elves to condemn necromancy, since they often live for hundreds of years or more. Why should mankind be condemned to a fraction of that time when there exists an opportunity to extend life? The ancient Lahmians venerated necromancy and they were among the most advanced civilisations of their time. The creation of undead minions is a situation borne out of necessity, when one is hunted across every acre of his homeland. On Daemonology: The warlock\u2019s trade with daemonkind is perhaps the truest example of his even-handed approach to the study of the aethyr. For what better specimen to learn from than a denizen of the aethyr itself! The summoning of daemons is a perilous business, but minor daemons are quite limited mentally and easy to control. Greater daemons can be a bit trickier to deal with, and it is imperative to establish dominance early. Adventure Seeds The Price of Power: A Strigoi vampire is willing to trade the ancient secrets of Blood Magic for assistance on a dangerous river journey. A vampire hunter, as well as a pair of Lahmian agents, are in close pursuit.

However, when someone wants to fulfil a petty act of vengeance against an enemy, they visit a witch. Witches usually live in seclusion, for their presence is unsettling to normal folk. Although few live up to reputation of old Bloody Bones, a mythical hell-hag used by parents throughout the Empire to scare children into behaving, most bear the marks of their undisciplined use of magic \u2013 disfigurement and eccentricity. It takes a brave soul to trek to the isolated cottage of a witch. For a few pennies, the witch will work her magic for the petitioner; sometimes she will use her art to heal, but usually it will be to curse an enemy or ruin a rival. For some witches, the power to cause fear and harm becomes an intoxicant, and they will begin to abuse their gift, and tyrannise their neighbours for personal gain. Such blatant misuse of dark magic sometimes attracts warlocks, who recruit witches to help them perform unspeakable rituals. A warlock will organise his minions into a coven, fashioning their erratic art into a tool of evil. There is no hope for witches who are beguiled in this way; although the most talented members of a coven might be favoured with the secrets of the warlock\u2019s power, all ultimately face either the damnation of their souls or the flickering pyres of the witch hunters. Gammer Moonsight Gammer Moonsight\u2019s tumbledown cottage in the hills of Stirh\u00fcgel is a beacon for those who seek miracle cures or want an enemy cursed. Fashionable gentleladies arrive in disguise from distant Altdorf to buy tinctures from this blind, half-deaf old woman, to bewitch their beaus or curse rivals. It is rumoured that the Gammer was once visited by an admiral of the Emperor\u2019s navy, who purchased a pouch of wind to scatter an invading Norse fleet. Luckily for the Gammer, her reputation has yet to reach the ears of priests and witch-hunters; events in this backward province are of little interest to those beyond its borders. However, the longer the authorities remain ignorant of her powers, the more dangerous the old woman will become. Gammer Moonsight, through no evil intent of her own, manifests dark magic whenever she carries out the desires of her clients, the majority of whom, selfish and spiteful, want her to harm rather than heal. Her use of petty curses has attracted an imp of Slaanesh, that has begun to worm its way into her soul. Eventually, she will be consumed by the evil demands of her petitioners, and her body will become a vessel for this vile daemon, imperiling everyone she comes into contact with. Adventure Seeds The Good Doctor: A philanthropic physician moves to the provinces, to improve the health of the peasants. To his frustration, modern medicine competes with old beliefs: the rustics prefer the remedies of wise women. The doctor embarks on a crusade to eradicate the witches. The adventurers can help or hinder him. A Crime of Passion: A young witch has been seduced by a noble who, greedy for inheritance, manipulates her into using her powers to kill his father. The noble then abandons the girl, letting her face the pyre for the crime he inspired. The adventurers become embroiled in the affair, untangling the truth to discover the real culprit.
